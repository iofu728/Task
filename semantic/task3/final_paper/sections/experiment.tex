\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

In this section, we evaluate in train, dev set. We use glove.6B.100d as our word embedding. And train our model for 140 epochs. We test our model in MSParS. \cite{MSParS}

The MSParS dataSet is a QA set. From our understanding, in this dataSet, you should extract Named entities. And then it also need to find relation of this entities.

After experiments, we get 66.08\% BLEU, 93.0\% accuracy in train set, and 65.63\% BLEU, 84.7\% accuracy in dev set.

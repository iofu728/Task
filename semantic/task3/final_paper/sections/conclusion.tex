\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce a deep-learning sematic parser model. Glove is the best way in our jobs on the embedding layer. And we test our model in MSParS DataSet. We achieve a 66.08\% BLEU, 93.0\% accuracy in train set, and 65.63\% BLEU, 84.7\% accuracy in dev set. After our work, we only test our model in MSParS DataSet. In the future, We can do more work in word representations, beam search, parser analysis.
